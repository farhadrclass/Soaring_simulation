Soaring_simulation
==================

This is a Autonomus Soaring algorithm, with the scripts required to simulate it's operation. It should be run using MATLAB, by executing the ```GUI.m``` file. For a more extensive explanation go to this [post](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ardusoar-cross-country-x-plane-simulation). Based on Peter Braswell's [Ardusoar code](http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/autonomous-soaring?xg_source=activity). Extended with a second measurement (thermal-induced roll moment), an Unscented Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, scripted and parallelized execution of soaring simulations in the context of Philipp Oettershagen's [Journal of Field Robotics publication](http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1002/rob.21765).

In the following picture shows the algorithm's estimate of the thermal center location (blue track).
