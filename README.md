Soaring_simulation
==================

This is a Autonomus Soaring algorithm, with the scripts required to simulate it's operation. It should be run using MATLAB, by executing the ```GUI.m``` file. For a more extensive explanation go to this [post](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ardusoar-cross-country-x-plane-simulation).

In the following picture shows the algorithm's estimate of the thermal center location (blue track).
